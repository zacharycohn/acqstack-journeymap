title: External Client Process
---

External clients include everyone outside of the Technology Transformation Service (TTS). This includes other federal agencies and departments, as well as other parts of GSA.

Other parts of TTS (OPP, Infrastructure, 18F, etc) are NOT considered external. 

For buys with External Clients, buy off the Agile BPA and work with the National Capital Region (NCR) of FAS as our official contracting office.
