title: Internal Clients
---

Internal clients include anyone within the Technology Transformation Service (TTS). This includes, but is not limited to, OPP (formerly OCSIT), TTS Infrastructure, TTS Operations, Transformation Services, Custom Partner Solutions, TTS Acquisitions, etc. 

Other parts of GSA (GSA IT, FAS, PBS, etc) are NOT considered internal. 

For buys with Internal Clients, we typically work with the National Capital Region (NCR) of FAS as our official contracting office. 

But as of November 2016, we have the opportunity to do do a pilot of 5 buys on our own (referred to as Internal Buys) using our Internal Procurement Authority. If you think your buy might be a good fit for an Internal Buy, please discuss with the Director and Deputy Director of TTS Acquisitions.
